<h2 data-i18n="terms.section1_title">§ 1 Scope</h2>
<p data-i18n="terms.section1_p1">(1) These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all contracts for the provision of repair services for PDA devices (Mobile Data Terminals) concluded between the Provider and its customers (hereinafter referred to as "Customer").</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section1_p2">(2) Deviating terms and conditions of the Customer shall not be recognized unless the Provider expressly agrees to their validity in writing.</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section1_p3">(3) These GTC apply to consumers (§ 13 BGB - German Civil Code) and entrepreneurs (§ 14 BGB), unless expressly differentiated.</p>
<h2 data-i18n="terms.section2_title">§ 2 Conclusion of Contract</h2>
<p data-i18n="terms.section2_p1">(1) The presentation of repair services on the website does not constitute a legally binding offer, but an invitation to submit a repair order (invitatio ad offerendum).</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section2_p2">(2) The Customer can place a repair order using the online RMA form on the Provider's website or in other text form (e.g., e-mail). By submitting the RMA form or placing the order, the Customer makes a binding offer to conclude a repair contract.</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section2_p3">(3) The Provider usually confirms receipt of the order by means of an automatic confirmation of receipt. This confirmation of receipt does not yet constitute acceptance of the offer.</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section2_p4">(4) After receipt and inspection of the device, the Provider usually prepares a cost estimate (Kostenvoranschlag - KVA). The contract is concluded when the Customer approves the KVA in text form (e.g., e-mail) and the Provider confirms acceptance or begins the repair.</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section2_p5">(5) In the case of recognized warranty claims (currently only Movfast brand, reseller must be named), the contract may also be concluded without a KVA.</p>
<h2 data-i18n="terms.section3_title">§ 3 Cost Estimate (KVA)</h2>
<p data-i18n="terms.section3_p1">(1) The cost estimate is generally free of charge, unless expressly agreed otherwise.</p>
<p>
<span data-i18n="terms.section3_p2">(2) If it becomes apparent during the repair that the repair costs are likely to exceed the KVA by more than 15%, the Provider will inform the Customer of this and obtain their consent to continue the repair at the changed costs.</span>
<strong style="color: red;" data-i18n="terms.section3_p2_note">[NOTE: Check/adjust percentage!]</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span data-i18n="terms.section3_p3">(3) If the Customer rejects the KVA or does not agree to a necessary excess, the device will be returned to the Customer in the condition after diagnosis. The Provider reserves the right to charge a reasonable expense allowance for the diagnosis.</span>
<strong style="color: red;" data-i18n="terms.section3_p3_note">[NOTE: CLARIFY AMOUNT AND CONDITIONS WITH A LAWYER!]</strong>
<span data-i18n="terms.section3_p3_shipping">The Customer shall bear the costs of return shipping.</span>
</p>
<h2 data-i18n="terms.section4_title">§ 4 Prices and Terms of Payment</h2>
<p data-i18n="terms.section4_p1">(1) The prices stated in the approved cost estimate or the prices according to the Provider's currently valid price list for warranty cases shall apply.</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section4_p2">(2) All prices include the statutory German value-added tax, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>
<span data-i18n="terms.section4_p3">(3) Payment of the invoice amount is due upon completion of the repair and invoicing.</span>
<strong style="color: red;" data-i18n="terms.section4_p3_note">[NOTE: Define payment methods and due dates precisely, e.g., prepayment, invoice, etc.]</strong>
</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section4_p4">(4) The Customer shall bear the costs of shipping the device to the Provider. The Provider shall bear the costs of return shipping within Germany after successful repair. For shipping abroad, the Customer shall bear the costs of return shipping.</p>
<h2 data-i18n="terms.section5_title">§ 5 Shipping, Transfer of Risk, Retention of Title</h2>
<p data-i18n="terms.section5_p1">(1) The Customer bears the risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the device during transport to the Provider.</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section5_p2">(2) The Provider ships the repaired device at its own risk to the Customer (for consumers) or at the Customer's risk (for entrepreneurs).</p>
<p data-i18n="terms.section5_p3">(3) The repaired device remains the property of the Provider until full payment has been received.</p>
